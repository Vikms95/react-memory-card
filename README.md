## Description

This is a memory card game that consists of 7 phases.
The user can click the cards that are displayed. Each time a card is clicked, the player will get one point added to their score. 
If the user clicks a card that was already clicked, the score will be reset to 0 and will be brought back to the beggining of the game (just like in old-school videogames :D).
The best score of the user in the current session will be stored between games so it can challenge itself with getting the highest score possible, or who knows, maybe beating the game ;)

## Project Objectives

1. Build a memory game of programming tools, languages and concepts
2. Learn the usage of functional components
3. Take my first steps with Typescript typing system

## What I've learnt with this project

1. Use of React hooks and learn their quirks and differences opposed to what the lifecycle methods do offer
2. Defining interfaces for a given variable, parameters or function return values
3. Setting up a project with React and Typescript
4. Organize state to make sure all the rerenders are provided with the synced information of state

## Technologies used

1. React
2. Typescript
3. Jest
